This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

### Timeline

 * Start Date: 1/28/25

 * Finish Date: 3/4/25

 * Hours Spent: 200 hours



### Attributions

 * Resources used for learning (including AI assistance)
 
 * Resources used directly (including AI assistance)
   * ChatGPT used to assist with writing JavaDoc comments
   * ChatGPT used to assist with debugging 

### Running the Program

 * Main class: Main.java

 * Data files needed: 
   * User must select a simulation xml file to load a new simulation
   * A language properties file
   * Simulation.properties
   * Version.properties
   * GridSettings.properties
   * InfoDisplay.properties

 * Interesting data files:

 * Key/Mouse inputs:
   * Zoom in/out: zooms in/out of the grid pane
   * Buttons are selected on click


### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:

 * Known Bugs:

 * Features implemented:
   * CELL-01 through CELL-16
   * CELL-26A, CELL-26C, CELL-26D, CELL-26E, CELL-26F
   * CELL-27, CELL-28, CELL-29, CELL-30, CELL-31
   * CELL-35, CELL-36, CELL-37, CELL-38, CELL-40, CELL-42, CELL-43, CELL-45C, CELL45D
   * CELL-52, CELL-53A, CELL-53E

 * Features unimplemented:

 * Noteworthy Features:

 * Running multiple simulations simultaneously:
   * All simulations run independently and are created by 
   initializing a new SimulationMaker object and calling makeSimulation()
   * Each simulation runs in an entirely new window, which is not organized in any particular arrangement

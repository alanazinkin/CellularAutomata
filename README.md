This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

### Timeline

 * Start Date: 1/28/25

 * Finish Date: 

 * Hours Spent:



### Attributions

 * Resources used for learning (including AI assistance)
 
 * Resources used directly (including AI assistance)


### Running the Program

 * Main class: Main.java

 * Data files needed: Simulation xml file is needed to load a new simulation

 * Interesting data files:

 * Key/Mouse inputs:



### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:

 * Known Bugs:

 * Features implemented:

 * Features unimplemented:

 * Noteworthy Features:

 * Running multiple simulations simultaneously:
   * All simulations run independently and are created by 
   initializing a new SimulationMaker object and calling makeSimulation()
   * Each simulation runs in an entirely new window, which is not organized in any particular arrangement

package cellsociety.model;
/**
 * Provides the core model components for cellular automata simulations.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the fundamental abstractions representing cellular automata,
 * including {@link cellsociety.model.Simulation}, {@link cellsociety.model.Grid},
 * {@link cellsociety.model.Cell}, and {@link cellsociety.model.StateInterface}.
 * These components work together to implement various cellular automata simulations
 * with different rules, states, and behaviors.
 *
 * <h2>Design Goals</h2>
 * <p>The model package aims to:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Provide a clean separation between model logic and visualization</li>
 *   <li>Support multiple simulation types through a common framework</li>
 *   <li>Enable configurable parameters such as grid size and edge behavior</li>
 *   <li>Facilitate step-by-step simulation with history tracking</li>
 *   <li>Allow for extensibility with new simulation types and rules</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Contracts</h2>
 * <p>Components in this package adhere to these contracts:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>View components must only interact with models through defined interfaces</li>
 *   <li>State changes only occur through controlled step() operations</li>
 *   <li>Cell state updates are calculated completely before being applied</li>
 *   <li>All states implement the StateInterface for consistent handling</li>
 *   <li>Simulation implementations must validate inputs to maintain integrity</li>
 * </ul>
